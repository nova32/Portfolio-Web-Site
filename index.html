    <p>Hello, my name is Issac Hannible and i am from Clovis. I am a High School student who is wanting to improve on knowledge. I take part in extracurricular activities like track, and CART. I worked with many people throughout my life, having to collaborate with others and discuss the process of steps needed for a project. I continue to gain new experiences with the things i do, and make sure i benefit from the experiences.
    </p>
